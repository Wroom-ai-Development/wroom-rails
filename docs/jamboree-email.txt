Dear Sir/Madam,
We are aware that there have been various reports and concerns regarding the Jamboree, particularly regarding the high temperatures at the event. Representations from scouting organizations in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United States have decided to withdraw from the event due to the high temperatures, which some members of their delegations are not able to cope with. We would like to provide you with an update on the situation at the Jamboree and the steps that our patrol and command are taking to ensure the well-being of the participants, as well as the measures being taken by the organizers.

It is true that Korea is currently experiencing high temperatures. In recent days, the temperature at the Jamboree site has consistently exceeded 35°C. Participants are notified about the high temperatures in advance by their patrol leaders, through the Jamboree application, and via alerts from the Korean government.

As the patrol leaders and command of the Polish delegation, we are taking care of our participants. Everyone has continuous access to drinking water, and our leaders make sure that everyone wears head coverings, avoids the sun whenever possible, wears appropriate clothing that covers their skin, and uses sunscreen. After noticing the problem, the delegation command has purchased special sleeves for all participants to protect them from the sun.

Before traveling to South Korea, the Polish delegation command provided each participant with essential items, including a hat, sunscreen, a reusable water bottle with a filter, lightweight viscose long-sleeved shirts, as well as umbrellas and sunglasses. On the Jamboree site, there are shading tunnels located along the main routes, which provide shelter from direct sunlight, as well as water taps. The organizers are providing additional shade and distributing bottled water and electrolytes.

There are a total of 5 medical clinics located in the hubs (organizational units for campsite areas) and a hospital on the Jamboree site. Additionally, there are 5 additional medical points, several ambulances, and medical vehicles. The Polish delegation command also has their own vehicles available if needed. The well-being of the participants is also taken care of by a psychologist and a doctor, who are part of the Polish delegation and provide assistance to participants from Poland only. Both professionals have been accompanying the delegation since the first day of the trip and can communicate in both Polish and English, with the psychologist also fluent in Korean.

It is important to note that the safety of the event is constantly monitored and supported by the South Korean Government, which has recently deployed additional staff to the Jamboree. Furthermore, an additional 500 individuals have been deployed to ensure cleanliness at the event site.

In collaboration with the South Korean Government, the organizers have provided the delegation commands with information regarding the measures that have already been taken and those planned in response to the heatwave:

- Additional shading tents for participants' relaxation are being installed in collaboration with the military.
- Several cooling points have been set up on the Jamboree site, located in buses. Cold water will also be distributed in these buses.
- Bottled water is distributed at various points throughout the Jamboree.
- Policemen, firefighters, and additional medical services have been deployed to increase safety.
- The program for participants will be flexible, taking weather conditions into account.
- Programs that require high physical activity will be suspended until weather conditions improve.
- During the extraordinary meeting of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which took place on August 4, it was announced that an additional budget of KRW 900 million has been allocated for the organization of the Jamboree. Additionally, KRW 30 billion will be allocated as special grants to support the event.

We are taking daily actions to ensure the comfort of the participants at the 25th World Scout Jamboree. We are in constant communication with the Consular Section of the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Seoul and the event organizers, with whom we share all our observations during daily meetings.

We would like to remind you that during our stay in South Korea, we have established the following methods of contact:

1. Firstly, we kindly ask you to contact the patrol leaders (guardians) directly, under whose care the participants are placed. The patrol leaders are the most knowledgeable about the current situation with the participants. However, they may not always have the time or be in a WIFI-covered area to respond to your inquiries, so we ask for your patience.

2. Secondly, we provide you with the contact number of Harcmistrzyni Anna Hałatek, who is available in Poland at +48 602 555 500. By calling Harcmistrzyni Anna, you will be able to ask any questions you may have, and she will pass them on to us, so we can provide a comprehensive response via email. Please note that Harcmistrzyni Anna is a volunteer, so there may be situations where she is unable to answer the phone.

3. We also provide a Korean phone number for Harcmistrz Maciej Szczęsny, the head of the delegation, at +821066998280. However, we kindly ask you to use this contact only if other forms of communication prove unsuccessful. Our priority during our stay in Korea is to ensure the proper care of your children, and that is where our efforts are focused. In this case, the preferred method of contact, due to high costs, is the WhatsApp messaging app.

Of course, we will also continue to respond to emails sent to jamboree2023@zhp.pl.

Please keep in mind that South Korea is in a different time zone than Poland (GMT +9). So, when it is 4 p.m. in Poland, it is already 11 p.m. in Korea. Both the staff and participants may already be asleep.
